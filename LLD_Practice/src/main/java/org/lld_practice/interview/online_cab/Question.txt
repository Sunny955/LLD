Design a ride sharing application where drivers can offer 
rides(origin, destination, no_of_seats), any rider can request ride 
(origin, destination, no_of_seats) 

The program should take as input 2 or more drivers and set of riders requesting rides. 
Multiple rides can happen simultaneously 

There is an algorithm to choose to calculate the ride amount charged for a given ride based on distance and no of seats - 

i) When the ride closes show the total amount charged to the rider
ii) Ride amount if no_of_seats >= 2: no_of_seats * no_of_kms*0.75*Amount_charged_per_KM
iii) Ride amount if seats =1: No_of_kms*Amount_charged_per_KM
